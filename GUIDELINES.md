# Development Guidelines

These rules guide all code changes in this project.

## 1. Keep Code Simple
- Avoid unnecessary files, classes, or abstractions.
- Prefer clear and minimal solutions over clever or complex ones without adding new files or complicated logic.

## 2. Improve Existing Logic Gradually
- Whenever modifying a feature, simplify old logic using newer, more efficient patterns.
- Do not change the user-facing functionality or break existing behavior.

## 3. Keep the README Updated
- Update `README.md` only when functionality changes or setup steps change.
- Keep all documentation concise and easy to read.
